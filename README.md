## Project Analysis
Making this project is realy fun. Android Development is awesome. Easy to get used to. 

An important concept I used in this project is ArrayAdapter. I am explaining it's usage with the help of an example. Suppose I have 500 contacts in my phone and I want to display it. One Approach is to display all while other is to display it dynamically i.e according to our use, or load it partially so for this kind of data management, android has given us the ArrayAdapter. An ArrayAdapter basically manages your data that may be get from an arraylist, a fie or a database dynamically that's why it's an important concept in android development.

## Notes
Getting used to with Adapter takes time but finally I did it.
